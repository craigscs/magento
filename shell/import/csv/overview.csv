Axler,N,6345,"The Axler Robin 20 Stabilizer S lets you capture smooth, free-floating handheld shots with camcorders and camera rigs weighing up to 7 pounds. The system employs a height-adjustable gimbal and three-stage center column which collapses to a compact, travel-ready size for convenient transport. The center column also makes it easy to balance heavier loads without increasing the weight of the stabilizer, letting you shoot for longer periods of time with less arm fatigue. Four counterweights are included, which fit onto two posts at the base of the stabilizer. 
The camera platform features a quick release plate for easy camera attachment, and allows for front-to-back and side-to-side adjustments for quick balancing. Once balanced, the stabilizer isolates the camera from your body movements, letting you walk or even climb stairs, all while capturing smooth, elegant-looking footage. The weight plate is outfitted with four rubber feet that can be rotated to reveal metal spikes. When you need to set the unit down, the feet offer a stable base for the stabilizer to stand upright on nearly any terrain.

A durable nylon carry case is included for easy storage and transport of the stabilizer and counterweights.",,"The <b>Axler Robin 20 Stabilizer S</b> lets you capture smooth, free-floating handheld shots with camcorders and camera rigs weighing up to 7 pounds.

Axler,N,8228,"The WISP-20M from Axler is a handheld motorized gimbal stabilizer designed for use with mirrorless or similarly sized cameras. It utilizes quiet brushless motors to isolate your camera from unwanted hand shake along the yaw (pan), pitch (tilt), and roll axes, allowing you capture smooth, fully stabilized shots with camera and lens combinations weighing up to 1.9 lb.

The gimbal stabilizer offers two distinct operating modes: a Follow Mode that allows the camera to smoothly follow the pan and tilt motion of the unit, and a Lock Mode to keep the camera in a single position, regardless of how the stabilizer is moved. A thumbstick on the back of the handle is used to switch between modes and adjust camera pan and pitch tilt. Additionally, a button on the camera platform activates a Low mode, lettings you invert the stabilizer for easier low-angle shots.

Designed for ease of use, the WISP-20M features a sliding quick release plate for quick camera attachment and balancing. An offset adapter plate is included to fit wider cameras or cameras with an off-center 1/4&quot;-20 socket. Once balanced, the internal gyros automatically stabilize your camera when the device is powered on. The motors are powered using three readily available 18650 rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which provide around 2 to 3 hours of continuous operation. Batteries and a micro-USB charging cable are included.

For added versatility, there is a 3/8&quot;-16 threaded socket at the bottom of the handle that allows the stabilizer to be mounted on a tripod, monopod, or jib.

Axler,N,9645,"The 20&quot; Axler Caterpillar is a compact camera slider that extends to 30&quot; of sliding length when mounted on a tripod or stand.

The Caterpillar is a belt-driven slider offering smooth movement for up to 13 lb loads. In addition to its adjustability in a mobile form factor, the Caterpillar is also designed with a few exceptional features that will provide for increased efficiency and convenience.

One of the outstanding features is a flip-brake that allows you to lock the sliding carriage into a fixed position in an instant. Also, instead of an integrated mounting screw on the sliding carriage, the Caterpillar features a small, pullout quick-release plate with a 1/4&quot;-20 screw and 3/8&quot;-16 bushing. This plate can be attached to cameras or video heads and then inserted into a slot on the carriage, and then it is quickly secured by tightening knobs on the sides of the carriage. The knobs can also be removed and replaced by included set screws to make room for larger tripod heads or cameras.

When used surface-mounted, the Caterpillar offers a sliding length of 18&quot;. It comes with screw-in feet that can be adjusted to different heights to compensate for any unevenness on the surface. A bubble level on the sliding carriage allows you to confirm whether you're level.

The Caterpillar has a dual twin-rail design and uses a durable Nylon tether to drive the carriage. It is supplied with a form fitting, zippered carry carry case.",,"The 20&quot; <b>Axler Caterpillar</b> is a compact camera slider that extends to 30&quot; of sliding length when mounted on a tripod or stand.<br />

Axler,N,10286,"Enjoy the trend towards mobility in the video world? Like being able to carry all your equipment in one bag? Well, here's a major addition to portability, the Foldable Crane Slider from Axler. But, its portability is just one of its features.

You can achieve smooth and steady linear slides, as well as parabolic slides--where the camera pans along with the slide while keeping the subject in frame. And, all this is done by moving a comfortable knob handle to one side or the other. The Foldable Crane Slider is designed for medium sized DSLRs and mirrorless cameras, and supports a max payload of 4.5 lb.

The slider attaches to your tripod facing forward, slides from the middle to either side a distance of 14&quot;, and extends out to 28&quot; from end to end. Using an included ball head, mount your camera on the &quot;Linear&quot; mounting point on the very front of the slider, and move it back to the &quot;Parabolic&quot; position for panning slides. Both positions offer a 1/4&quot;-20 mounting screw. The ball head is compact and made of aluminum, but you can use any other matching ball head if you'd like.

When you're done and ready to pack the slider away, just set the lock into position, and the slider will stay folded in your bag.

The Foldable Crane Slider is made of aluminum and has ABS plastic side panels. It features a 3/8&quot;-16 tripod mount thread on the bottom and works well with standard tripods and hi-hats.",,"Enjoy the trend towards mobility in the video world?
